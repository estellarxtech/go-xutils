# XUtils - a Golang Toolkit for Development

## Introduction

A collection of tools designed to improve your day-to-day development tasks.

* **aes**: This directory contains code or scripts related to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), a symmetric encryption algorithm used to secure data.

* **bools**: This folder includes utilities or functions that operate on boolean values, such as logical operations or boolean algebra tools.

* **calc**: Short for "calculator," this directory houses programs or scripts that perform various mathematical calculations.

* **cnpj**: Specific to Brazil's National Registry of Legal Entities (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica), this contains validation or generation scripts for CNPJ numbers.

* **convs**: Likely shorthand for "conversions," this folder contains code that handles the conversion between different data types or units.

* **cpf**: Similar to `cnpj`, this directory relates to the Brazilian Individual Taxpayer Registry (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas), with scripts for CPF number validation or generation.

* **csv**: Known for "Comma-Separated Values," this folder includes tools or scripts for processing CSV files, with a `data` subdirectory that may contain actual CSV files.

* **email**: This directory contains scripts or libraries for handling email operations, such as sending, receiving, or validating email addresses.

* **examples**: Typically, this folder includes example scripts or code snippets demonstrating how to use the libraries or functions found in the other directories.

* **geo**: This folder deals with geographical computations or data processing, such as location validation, coordinates conversion, or mapping functions.

* **hash**: This directory contains functions for generating or verifying hash values, used in cryptography, data integrity, and password storage.

* **ip**: This is a collection of utilities for handling IP addresses, including validation, conversion, or network calculations.

* **phone**: This directory is dedicated to phone number processing, such as formatting, validating, or extracting information from phone numbers.

* **rsa**: Named after the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm, this folder contains cryptographic code related to RSA encryption and decryption.

* **slices**: In programming, especially in languages like Go, slices are a data structure. This directory includes utilities for manipulating these structures.

* **strings**: This folder contains functions and utilities for string manipulation, such as formatting, parsing, or analyzing text data.

* **structs**: In languages like Go, structs are a way of defining complex data types. This directory includes definitions and utilities for working with structs.

* **xls**: This directory is related to Excel spreadsheet processing, with tools for reading, writing, or manipulating `xls` files. The `data` subdirectory might contain sample spreadsheets or data sets.

Each directory serves a specific purpose, reflecting the modular and organized structure of a well-designed software project.
